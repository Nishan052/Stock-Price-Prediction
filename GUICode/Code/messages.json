For example, if the predicted price is ‚Çπ10,000 and the RMSE range is ‚Çπ9,800‚Äì‚Çπ10,200, it means the actual price may be around ‚Çπ10,000, but could vary by a few hundred rupees.\n\n- **MAPE Range**: This shows the possible price range in percentage terms. It tells you how much the prediction could be off by, based on past performance. For example, if the MAPE range is ‚Çπ9,700‚Äì‚Çπ10,300, then the actual price is likely to fall somewhere in that range.\n\nThese ranges help interpret the model's accuracy, not provide financial advice.",
